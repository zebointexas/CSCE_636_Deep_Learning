In this paper, we presented an stock prediction framework called \scheme\ which consists of various types of NNs. We attempted to predict the stock value with different network topologies with different features vector. Here we show how NN can be used as a good stock predictor that can easily trained compared to other machine learning model. We proposed different neural network architecture and
contrasted them against different hand-based state-of-the art statistical indicator and machine learning technique. We shown that given enough data and different features vector neural network performs can better than other machine learning model and it also becomes much easier to train.
